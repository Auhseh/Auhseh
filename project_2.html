                        <h2>The Challenge</h2>

                    <p class="body_text_case">
                        With the dynamic evolution of the labor market and the ravaging effects of the pandemic,
                        the hiring process has become more complex and nuanced and Hiring managers and
                        recruiters have had to evolve with the times, The need for innovation
                        In this space has mainly been driven by the volume of applicants for a
                        plethora of jobs and the need to efficiently manage the whole recruitment
                        process remote-first.
                    </p>

                    <br>
                    <br>

                    <p class="body_text_case">
                        The project brief had four main goals: Allow recruiters;
                    </p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Receive Applications</li>
                        <li>Conduct Assessments</li>
                        <li>Assign Tasks</li>
                        <li>Conduct Virtual Interviews</li>

                    <br>
                    <br>


                    <h2>Exploration</h2>


                    <p class="body_text_case">Before the project commenced, i had very limited knowledge of Applicant Tracking Software (ATS)
                        and the recruiting industry in general, Hence the first step was acquainting myself
                        with the industry, So i conducted a quick industry overview which
                        gave me enough insights to get started, after which i proceeded to use
                        the Assumption and Questions method to articulate my findings.
                        </p>

                        <br>
                    <h2>Research</h2>



                    <p class="body_text_case">With my preliminary industry overview and data from the Assumptions and Questions exercise,
                        I had a fair knowledge of the space, next was delving deeper, due to the pandemic
                        I was limited to conducting virtual interviews which I supplemented with extensive
                        secondary research comprising; more recruiter interviews online, blogs, forums etc.
                        there were pertinent questions I needed to answer that would form the core of
                        my solution:
                        </p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Why did this product need to exist?</li>
                        <li>What was the current state of existing solutions? </li>
                        <li>What didn’t they like about current solutions?</li>
                        <li>How did I want users to feel using my solution?</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p class="body_text_case">To make sense of all the data from the research,
                        I used the As-is Scenario map to illustrate my findings and glean more insights.</p>

                    <img class="project_hero" src="/Assets/As-is Scenario map – 1@2x.png" alt="">



                    <p class="body_text_case">
                        I was also able to distill responses and findings to visualize users’
                        biggest paint points with existing solutions and articulate a user persona.
                        <br>

                    <h2>Information Architecture</h2>

                    <p class="body_text_case">
                        In articulating the information architecture, the main influences were
                        the four main goals of the project and insights from my research,
                        I chose to prioritize ease of navigation with the architecture thus reducing effort investments (Number of decisions/additional activities a user has to make/perform
                        to complete the process.) by adding a universal search and sticky menus.

                    <h2>Sketches and wireframes</h2>

                    <p class="body_text_case">
                        By prioritizing easy navigation, a menu had to be accessible on every page and this was probably the biggest
                        challenge to tackle while simultaneously creating an intuitive, de-cluttered layout.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Final designs and rationales</h2>

                    <p class="body_text_case">
                        For the overall look and aesthetic, I settled for a friendly and modern look with
                        rounded rectangles, the rationale behind this was, from my research,
                        i discovered that recruiters indeed spent the bulk of their working hours
                        in the ATS and some of the recurring themes they disliked with the current
                        solutions were, “antiquated”, “unintuitive UI & UX” etc.
                        I tried making the app reminiscent of most of the consumer apps people use daily.
                    </p>

                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <br>



                    <h3>Style Guide</h3>

                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <br>


                    <h3>Home Portal</h3>
                    <img class="project_hero" src="/Assets/Home portal – 2@2x.png" alt="">

                    <br>
                    <br>

                    <p class="body_text_case">
                       <strong>Goal</strong>: Keeping users up to date on their workflow
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <strong>How</strong>: The Home portal is the first page a user sees when they open the program; here I tried to make it as simple and intuitive as possible, I was inspired by gamification and explored adding a “Continue from last session” feature here users could be up to date on their workflow and choose to continue work in progress with ease.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <strong>Challenges</strong>: My main challenge was fitting every important component into a single non-scrollable page in a way that would be scalable in the future. I opted for using cards as that would be easily adapted to mobile.

                    </p>

                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <br>

                    <h3>Sticky Menus</h3>
                    <img class="project_hero" src="/Assets/sticky@2x.png" alt="">

                    <br>
                    <br>

                    <p class="body_text_case">
                       <strong>Goal</strong>: Easy Navigation throughout the app
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <strong>How</strong>: On the top of the page is the main menu which covers the main goals of the project, while the sub menu on the left side is populated with solutions to pain points from user research
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <strong>Challenges</strong>: The main challenge here was fitting the menu on each page and keeping each page de-cluttered and intuitive. Major crux was having two menus on every page vs one menu. With easy navigation as a priority, I settled on the former, plus two menus turned out to be scalable for mobile (one horizontal sticky menu and a drop down menu).
                        I also explored one menu with all the items but this came out overwhelming to the user and having two menus helped prioritize actions hierarchically.

                    <h3>Clustering and Filtering</h3>
                    <img class="project_hero" src="/Assets/Applicants – 33@2x.png" alt="">

                    <br>

                    <p class="body_text_case">
                       <strong>Goal</strong>: Easily navigating and filtering through applicants.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <strong>How</strong>: This addressed one of the main goals of the project which was ‘Receiving Applications’, here I tried to have the system do most of the work, thus reducing the cognitive effort from the user, the flow was basically broken down into <strong>Applications = Job type > Applicant list > Applicant profile. </strong>

                        <br>
                        <br>

                    <p class="body_text_case">
                        I also added a filter menu on the Applicant list page and an Import button, these gave the user the option to further fine tune the search and import a list of applicants respectively.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <strong>Challenges</strong>: My main challenge was presenting the information in a way that looked least overwhelming to the user, especially in situations where there were hundreds of applications to go through. I tackled this by prioritizing whitespace and using a grid card layout for the Job type page and a simple list layout for the Applicant list page
                    </p>

                       <strong>Goal</strong>: Easy communication, Scheduling and Tools.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <strong>How</strong>: Communication and collaboration were two recurrent themes in my research, to efficiently tackle these I added a Contact list and Messaging feature which allowed recruiters add colleagues to their contact lists and message them directly (messages go straight to colleagues email inbox), for interviews , I also added a calendar and scheduling feature.

                        <br>
                        <strong>Challenges</strong>: Main challenge was figuring out integrations, with user complaints around segmentation of tools
                        and scheduling, the system needed to allow users complete the full interview cycle
                        in-app (Planning > Scheduling > Interview). Nagging questions included:
                    </p>

                        <ul>
                            <li>How will live interviews work ? </li>

                            The ultimate goal was enabling users complete the bulk of the work in-app and
                        reduce time spent shuffling between apps to complete routine tasks.
                        I took inspiration from Slack and prioritized integration of the most
                        important external tools.

                        My biggest challenge was time, I had just 72 hours to complete the project and while I think I did okay, I honestly think a lot more can be re-imagined around:

                        Completing this project was a fun and challenging endeavor, I learnt a lot from the project and my biggest lessons were the importance of user research and designing incrementally (not trying to fit in every feature at first iteration).
